# Intro to JS Testing Workshop

The goal of this workshop is to develop a solid grasp of the fundamentals of JavaScript testing by implementing a basic testing framework. We will write our own test runner, assertion library, and library for rendering and inspecting React components.

We will work our way through this over the course of 5 lessons:

1. Basic assertions
2. An assertion library (replacing Chai)
3. A test framework (replacing Mocha)
4. Rendering and testing a React component (replacing Enzyme)
5. Polishing our API
